## Lead Instructor Experience
### 2024
#### “3D Printed Earth – HACKATHON”. Columbia GSAPP Master’s students. With Prof. Dr. Lola Ben-Alon and Prof. Dr. Shiho Kawashima.<br/>At Carleton Laboratory (Columbia Engineering). 
Role: Lead Instructor during five days workshop:
- Supervised and trained master students in digital fabrication and during the 3D printing sessions
- Supervised students during the design phase to assure the printability of 3D models
- Defined the extrudable material mixtures (in terms of earth, natural fibers and biopolymers) used during the workshop
- Prepared the Grasshopper script to generate the GCODE for 3D-printing with the SCARA Elite v2 robotic arm.

### 2023
#### “Circular Materials scouting”. MRAC students.<br/>At Master Material Balance Design: Digital techniques and circular innovations in architecture (Politecnico di Milano). 
Role: Faculty member 
- Prepared lectures on the most used construction materials in terms of their origin, processes, sustainability and availability
- Advised on the material selection phase of the students’ annual project 

### 2022
#### "Material stories - between metrics and narrative”.<br/>MRAC01 students At IAAC- Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia. 
Role: Faculty member
- Prepared lectures on the most used construction materials in terms of their origin, processes, sustainability metrics and availability
- Moderate on  the “material debate” among students 

### 2022
#### “Material Balance Design and Sustainable Products”. MRAC students.<br/>At SOS School of Sustainability master’s in Design for Sustainability. 
Role: Faculty member
- Prepared lectures on materiality and textures of construction materials
