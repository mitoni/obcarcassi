## Lead Instructor Experience
### 2024
#### “3D Printed Earth – HACKATHON” Columbia GSAPP Master’s students.
At **Columbia Engineering**, Carleton Laboratory.

With Prof. Dr. Lola Ben-Alon and Prof. Dr. Shiho Kawashima.

Role: Lead Instructor during five days workshop:
- Supervised and trained master students in digital fabrication and during the 3D printing sessions
- Supervised students during the design phase to assure the printability of 3D models
- Defined the extrudable material mixtures (in terms of earth, natural fibers and biopolymers) used during the workshop
- Prepared the Grasshopper script to generate the GCODE for 3D-printing with the SCARA Elite v2 robotic arm.

### 2023
#### “Circular Materials scouting”. MRAC students.
At **Politecnico di Milano**, Master Material Balance Design: Digital techniques and circular innovations in architecture.

Role: Faculty member 
- Prepared lectures on the most used construction materials in terms of their origin, processes, sustainability and availability
- Advised on the material selection phase of the students’ annual project 

### 2022
#### "Material stories - between metrics and narrative” MRAC01 students 

At **IAAC- Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia**. 

Role: Faculty member
- Prepared lectures on the most used construction materials in terms of their origin, processes, sustainability metrics and availability
- Moderate on  the “material debate” among students 

### 2022
#### “Material Balance Design and Sustainable Products” MRAC students.
At **SOS School of Sustainability**

Role: Faculty member
- Prepared lectures on materiality and textures of construction materials
