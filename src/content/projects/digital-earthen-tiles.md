The investigation focused on the translation of the arab shading element - the Mashrabiya typology - into light and thin earth tiles 3D printable as a continous line.

The significance of this research lies in the development of a methodology for identifying novel mix design for digital fabrication, by increasing carbon storing vegetable fiber content within digital earth, and by creating a range of structurally sound natural 3D printed assembly types: from mass-insulation walls to paper-thin lightweight partition assemblage.
