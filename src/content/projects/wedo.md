This project aims to create a web application that connects organic waste producers (referred to as GIVERS) with designers and creators (referred to as USERS) who are interested in developing products using locally sourced materials.

It addresses the questions:
“How can we change the way we source local materials? How can designers be directly connected with the available organic waste in their region and incorporate it into their projects or product development?”

The project facilitates the tracking of potential material supply chains for design purposes by inviting waste producers to upload information about the type, quantity, and location of their organic waste directly to the app, ensuring real-time and reliable data.

Current material mapping projects often rely on official databases (e.g., FAOSTAT) and statistics. For instance, agricultural production and its related organic wastes are typically calculated using field-based data collection methods, which include input from farmers involved in commercial and governmental programs and annual residue surveys. Remote sensing provides multi-spectral and hyper-spectral datasets for mapping and monitoring vegetation density over large areas; however, this still constitutes secondary data.

In contrast, this project’s objective is to provide primary data that, over time, could be used to predict material availability with AI algorithms. This could assist in customizing the next generation of natural materials according to the bioregional context.
