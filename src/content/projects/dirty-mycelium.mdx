Embarking on one of nature’s architects: mycelium, this project includes a tile system fabricating with molding techniques. The main goal is to investigate thresholds and the potentials of growing mycelium on light fiber-clay mixture designs within “dirty” settings.

Beyond its potential as a low-carbon, lightweight, and insulative material, mycelium illuminates the following question: how can architecture build more reciprocal connections with natural environments?

The final prototype has been exhibited during the «Mycelium Movement» at the Movement Lab (Barnard College) curated by Grace Schleck
