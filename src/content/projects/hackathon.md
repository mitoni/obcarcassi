This hackathon aims to provide an immersive, hands-on exploration into various earth-based materials and their digital fabrication through 3D printing. 

Drawing inspiration from traditional techniques like adobe and exploring speculative geometries across different scales, we aim to envision potential futures for earth materials.

For the final stage, 10 students collaborated in teams to create inventive earth-based design fabrications.

## Contribution
- Supervised and trained master students in digital fabrication and during the 3D printing sessions
- Supervised students during the design phase to assure the printability of 3D models
- Defined the extrudable material mixtures (in terms of earth, natural fibers and biopolymers) used during the workshop
- Prepared the Grasshopper script to generate the GCODE for 3D-printing with the SCARA Elite v2 robotic arm.
