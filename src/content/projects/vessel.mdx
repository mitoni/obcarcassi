This series of 3D printed artifacts presents an ongoing experimental material design investigation of traditional basketry and textile-based techniques, utilizing radically low-carbon and non-toxic geo- and bio-materials. Employing digital 3D printing techniques to reimagine ancient materials, this project seeks to reconnect constructed forms and inspire a profound remembrance of our connection to the soil, our birthplace, and underscore the essential stewardship required for our survival.

Clay-rich earthen soils are here added with plant fibers from bast, stem, and leaf sources: kenaf, wheat straw, flax, banana, and other agricultural co-products in a material kitchens approach. These materials are used here transformed with water to enrich the built environment, and then transcend back to the land as nutrients. Through hybrid co-creation approaches, this exploration invites new textures, porosities, and new definitions of digital “cleanliness”.
