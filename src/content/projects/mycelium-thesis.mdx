This project wants to propose a design strategy to achieve the climate-neutrality for buildings with the use of fast-growing biomass insulation materials as GHG compensation.

Moreover, to lower the impacts also in the construction phase, it investigates the creation of sustainable materials and production cycles by exploiting the mycelium growth as a binder and create 100% bio-based insulation composites.
