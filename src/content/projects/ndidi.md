NDIDI is a computationally designed stool made from earth-based and mezcal residues, selected for exhibition at Mexico Design Week 2024. 

This stool is more than just a piece of furniture; it celebrates the synergy between 3D printing and craftsmanship, highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of women in the mezcal industry.

By combining advanced technologies and codesign principles with the manual skills of women from Mexican rural communities, NDIDI not only offers alternatives for local development but also points towards a more regenerative future.
