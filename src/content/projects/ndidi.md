YAVI is a computationally designed stool from NDIDI, an international platform for collaboration and design, created by Olga Caracassi and Alejandro Montes González under the vision of COAA, to address the problems of today's world through sustainable and inclusive design.

YAVI was exhibited at Inédito—Mexico Design Week 2024, the project used a custom 3D-printed mold, reducing the element’s weight by 50% without compromising durability. By integrating local expertise with advanced design, we sought to empower these women, highlight their overlooked contributions, and advocate for sustainable, community-centered design practices that resonate with their cultural heritage

This stool is more than just a piece of furniture; it celebrates the synergy between 3D printing and craftsmanship, highlighting the often-overlooked contributions of women in the mezcal industry. 

NDIDI is committed to redefining luxury by fostering collaborations that emphasize inclusivity, resilience, and ecological integrity, standing against traditional notions of exclusivity and exploitation

By combining advanced technologies and codesign principles with the manual skills of women from Mexican rural communities, YAVI not only offers alternatives for local development but also points towards a more regenerative future.
